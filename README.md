# PureMarkov
PureMarkov is a from-scratch implementation of next-word prediction using Markov chains, written in Python with a functional programming approach. Instead of relying on external NLP libraries, the project constructs every component manually â€” from tokenization and transition mapping to probability normalization and sampling.
